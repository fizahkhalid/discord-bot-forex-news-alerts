# Forex News & Scheduled Message Discord Bot

## 📌 Overview
This is a **Discord bot** that automates **Forex news reminders** and allows for scheduled message operations within a Discord server. It is designed to provide timely updates on Forex events based on user-configured filters and timezones.

The bot:
- **Scrapes Forex news** from the [`forex_factory_calendar_news_scraper`](https://github.com/fizahkhalid/forex_factory_calendar_news_scraper) repository.
- **Schedules automatic news updates** for Forex-related events.
- **Supports custom timezones and currency filters**.
- **Includes various utility commands** for checking time, setting preferences, and managing news updates.

⚠️ **Note:** This bot was written a long time ago, and while it works, the codebase could be greatly simplified. I plan to refactor and improve it when I have time. If anything is unclear, feel free to ask!
